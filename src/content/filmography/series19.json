    "Tianji Tower, the leading organisation of the pugilistic world is determined to overthrow Liu Zi Ye, the tyrannical ruler of the Liu Song dynasty. To achieve their mission, Tianji Tower replaces his sister Liu Chu Yu with their own disciple and Princess-lookalike Zhu Que. Zhu Que meets the Princess’ learned companion Rong Zhi, who turns out to be a spy from Northern Wei.",
    "Liu Chu Yu and Rong Zhi’s relationship eventually breaks down over misunderstandings and differing loyalties, and the latter fakes his death in order to regain Chuyu’s forgiveness. Then Liu Chu Yu as her memories erased by imperial astrologer and Rong Zhi gets his mind wiped. They meet five years later when Chu Yu is sent to marry Northern Wei’s Prince regent, who is none other than the now Rong Zhi.",
