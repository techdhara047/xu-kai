The top lawyer firm, Cheng & Hui is recruiting lawyers specializing in family affairs, and one of the requirements is to be married. Qin Wenyu, Qin Shi's second brother who is also a headhunter, secretly changed Qin Shi's marriage status to 'married' without her permission, thus creating a fictional husband for her out of nowhere. Not knowing anything, Qin Shi was employed. Her outstanding performance earned the approval of the founder, Lao Jin. During a gathering with partners, Lao Jin recommended Qin Shi to be a legal counsel for the Association of Women Entrepreneurs. It is only then Qin Shi realizes that she is 'married'.
