    "Mai Cheng Huan, a girl born into an ordinary family in Shanghai in the 1990s, is urged by her mother, Liu Wan Yu, to discuss marriage with her boyfriend, Xin Jia Liang. However, the affluent economic conditions of Xin's family upset the originally equal emotional relationship. At the same time, Mai's mother's excessive interference in her daughter's lifelong affairs accelerates the breakup between Mai Cheng Huan and Xin Jia Liang.",
    "Caught between filial piety and loyalty to oneself, Mai Cheng Huan struggles. She gradually breaks free from her mother's dominant care and becomes more focused and enterprising in her work. Mai Cheng Huan's transformation is recognized by her grandmother, who entrusts her with the important responsibility of managing the family's most valued hotel business.",
    "Yao Zhi Ming, the grandson of the grandmother and a professional hotel manager, gradually understands and approves of Mai Cheng Huan in their cooperation. They become work partners, advancing hand in hand. In their personal lives, Yao Zhi Ming is surrounded by the warmth beneath the fireworks of the Mai family, and his feelings for Mai Cheng Huan gradually heat up. From beneath Cheng Huan's knees to achieving self, Mai Cheng Huan has embarked on an extraordinary journey of growth that is uniquely her own.",
