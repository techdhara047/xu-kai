    "In 18th century Beijing, during the 6th year of Qianlong Emperor's reign, Wei Ying Luo enters the Forbidden City as an embroiderer to investigate the truth behind her older sister's rape and murder. Believing that Imperial Guard Fuca Fuheng is the prime suspect, Ying Luo schemingly approaches his sister, Empress Fuca Rongyin, and is transferred to work as her maid.",
    "Quickly taking on a liking to Ying Luo's streetsmart and plucky attitude, the kind-hearted Empress teaches her to read and write and becomes her benefactor, while Fuca Fuheng falls in love with her and supports her investigation. Realizing that the Fuca siblings are innocent of the crime, Ying Luo moves her attention to the other people in the palace in hopes of finding the perpetrator, all while protecting the Empress from the harem's conspiracies, as she rises through the ranks.",
