    "Wu Zhen has a prominent status. Her sister is the queen, and her father is the Duke of Henan. She has been pampered since she was a child. She has a free and uninhibited personality and often wears men's clothes, visits the Lefang brothel, and takes a group of children from aristocratic families around for fun; she became infamous as the famous dandy in Chang'an City. She was able to see spirits at a very young age. When she was young, she accidentally fell from a building and was rescued by her former cat master. She inherited his demon power and became the new cat master, secretly in charge of the Chang'an Demon City.",
    "Mei Zhu Yu is the nephew of a noble concubine. Like Wu Zhen, he can also see spirits. He was sent to a Taoist temple to practice at a young age. He is extremely talented. At a young age, he is already one of the best in Taoism. He can hide his spiritual power, just like ordinary people."
